### Release Notes

This release is all about Chromium. Ignalia has announced an [intent to ship](https://www.igalia.com/2022/06/22/Intent-to-Ship-MathML.html) MathML in Chromium. In anticipation of that event, this version of Temml is written to support both Firefox and Chromium.

Those two implementations are not written to the same specification. So Temml’s MathML must conform simultaneously to both [MathML 3]( https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/) (Firefox) and [MathML Core](https://w3c.github.io/mathml-core/) (Chromium). Given that challenge, I’m pretty happy with how well it has turned out. Temml emulates several hundred LaTeX functions and nearly all of them work very well.

It’s not all perfect. In this version, Temml drops support for `\cancelto`, `\toggle`, `\texttip`, `\phase`, and `\longdiv`. I think that `\toggle` and `\texttip` are probably gone forever. The others I hope to restore someday after Chromium fully supports the `menclose` element.

Also, Chromium’s implementation of MathML is new and not yet mature. It fails with some stretchy accents and extensible arrows. Chromium cannot yet print a page that contains MathML. I’m testing this in Chrome Canary and those issues may be worked out before MathML is shipped.
