*Temml* is a LaTeX-to-MathML JavaScript conversion utility. It is built to be lightweight.

| Library       | Minified JavaScript + CSS |
|:--------------|:-------------------------:|
| Temml         |         147 KB            |
| MathJax 2.7.5 |         338 KB            |
| KaTeX         |         280 KB            |
| TeXZilla      |         168 KB            |

As a futher advantage, Temml can use local system fonts. The minimum Temml installation serves a font file that is only 12kb. Sadly, Chromium has some rendering bugs when using system fonts. It
work better with the Latin Modern font, a 380 KB file.

Temml’s coverage of LaTeX functions is as good as MathJax, slightly better than KaTeX 0.16.0 and substantially better than TeXZilla. See a [detailed coverage comparison](https://temml.org/docs/en/comparison.html).

Temml's test suite includes many rendered examples, including the Temml [supported functions page](https://temml.org/docs/en/supported.html) and tests from [Mozilla](https://temml.org/tests/mozilla-tests.html), [Wikipedia](https://temml.org/tests/wiki-tests.html), [mhchem](https://temml.org/tests/mhchem-tests.html), and [LaTeXML](https://temml.org/tests/LaTeXML-tests.html).

Temml's demonstration page is at https://temml.org/

### Acknowledgements

I built Temml by:

1. Forking [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).

2. Deleting half the code, removing the HTML parts and keeping the parser, the macro expander, and the MathML parts.

3. Doing some code refactoring and many MathML bug fixes.

4. Adding new functionality: upright lower-case Greek letters, `\euro`, `\label{…}`, `\ref{…}`, `\prescript`, `\definecolor`, `xcolor` color names, etc.

I wish to thank Khan Academy and the many volunteer KaTeX contributors. This library would not exist if KaTeX had not existed first.
